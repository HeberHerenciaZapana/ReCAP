# ReCAP - Repository of Cognitive Attack Patterns

## Introduction
ReCAP (Repository for Cognitive Attack Patterns) is a comprehensive resource dedicated to cybersecurity in extended reality (XR) systems, including mixed reality (MR) and other immersive technologies. It catalogs known adversarial attack strategies—especially those exploiting cognitive vulnerabilities—to help developers and analysts identify and mitigate threats throughout the development and use of XR systems.
